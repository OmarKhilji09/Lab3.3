In this part of the assignment I create a word counter for the user input and displayed it at the top. I created 
the text area field and a paragraph and a span tag to target those values in javascript. I retrieved those tags
through document.getElementById and assigned them into variables to use them in my javascript. 

After the setup I created a wordCounter function and got my user input. I initialzed a word counter and set it to 0.
I looped through the words and added to the counter after every space. Finally, displayed the counter variable to 
the span tag with the counter id. I added some CSS styles to give it a better look.

The JS code is implented in the HTML via scrpit tags.
